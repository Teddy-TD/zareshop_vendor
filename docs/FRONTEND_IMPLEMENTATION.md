# Frontend Product Management Implementation

This document describes the frontend implementation for the product management system in the ZARE vendor app.

## Overview

The frontend implementation provides a complete product management interface that integrates with the backend API. It includes:

- Product listing with search and filtering
- Product creation with file uploads
- Product editing with existing file management
- Product detail viewing
- Real-time upload progress tracking

## Screens

### 1. Products List (`app/(tabs)/products.tsx`)
- Displays all products with pagination
- Search functionality
- Category filtering
- Product actions (view, edit, delete)
- Stock status indicators

### 2. Add Product (`app/products/add-product.tsx`)
- Product information form
- Category and subcategory selection
- Image and video upload (max 10 images, 5 videos)
- Product specifications
- File validation and size limits
- Upload progress tracking

### 3. Edit Product (`app/products/edit-product.tsx`)
- Pre-populated form with existing product data
- Manage existing images and videos
- Add new media files
- Update product information
- Maintain file limits

### 4. Product Detail (`app/products/product-detail.tsx`)
- Comprehensive product information display
- Image and video galleries
- Product specifications
- Vendor and category information
- Rating information
- Edit and delete actions

## Components

### ProductUploadProgress
- Displays real-time upload progress
- Shows job status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
- Summary statistics
- Individual file status tracking

### AnimatedCard
- Provides smooth animations for product cards
- Consistent styling across the app

### CustomButton
- Reusable button component
- Loading states and icons support

## API Integration

### Product API Service (`services/productApi.ts`)
- RTK Query implementation
- Type-safe API calls
- Automatic caching and invalidation
- File upload handling

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /products` - List products with pagination
- `POST /products` - Create new product
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update existing product
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product
- `GET /products/:id` - Get product details

## File Upload System

### Supported Formats
- **Images**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP (max 10MB)
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM (max 100MB)

### Upload Process
1. Files are validated on the frontend
2. Product is created with placeholder file references
3. Files are queued for background processing
4. Upload progress is tracked in real-time
5. Users can monitor job status

### Queue Management
- Bull Queue integration on the backend
- Job status tracking (queued, processing, completed, failed)
- Automatic retry on failure
- Background processing for better user experience

## State Management

### Local State
- Form data management
- File selection and preview
- UI state (dropdowns, loading states)
- Upload job tracking

### Global State (RTK Query)
- Product data caching
- API response caching
- Automatic background updates
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Navigation

### Routing Structure
```
/products/
├── add-product
├── edit-product
└── product-detail
```

### Navigation Flow
1. Products List → Add Product
2. Products List → Product Detail
3. Product Detail → Edit Product
4. Edit Product → Product Detail (after update)

## Error Handling

### Validation
- Form validation before submission
- File type and size validation
- Required field validation
- User-friendly error messages

### API Errors
- Network error handling
- Server error responses
- User-friendly error alerts
- Retry mechanisms

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Optimization
- Image compression before upload
- Thumbnail generation
- Lazy loading for large lists

### Caching
- RTK Query automatic caching
- Optimistic updates
- Background refetching

### File Handling
- Memory-efficient file processing
- Background uploads
- Progress tracking without blocking UI

## Security Features

### File Validation
- File type verification
- Size limit enforcement
- Malicious file prevention

### Input Sanitization
- Form data validation
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection (handled by backend)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time upload status updates via WebSocket
- Bulk product operations
- Advanced search and filtering
- Product templates
- Import/export functionality

### Technical Improvements
- Offline support
- Progressive Web App features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance monitoring

## Testing

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests

### Integration Testing
- API integration tests
- Navigation flow tests
- File upload tests

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- React Native
- Expo Router
- RTK Query
- Expo Image Picker

### UI Dependencies
- Lucide React Native (icons)
- Custom theme system
- Animated components

## Getting Started

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Configure the backend API endpoint
3. Set up file upload permissions
4. Test the product creation flow
5. Verify file upload functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- File upload failures: Check file size and format
- API errors: Verify backend connectivity
- Navigation issues: Check route configuration
- Performance issues: Monitor file sizes and caching

### Debug Mode
- Enable React Native debugger
- Check network requests
- Monitor file upload progress
- Verify API responses
